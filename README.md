# Flask ModelVis Example
This is a quick model visualization project hacked together

The idea was to look at attendance levels for football stadiums and build a simple predictive model for showing off how to quickly visualize data and the inputs / outputs of a model.
This is built with Angular as the front end and Flask as the backend as a quick 1 page demo for Chicago and 1 page demo for Buffalo

Data visualizations were taking advantage of angular nvd3.
